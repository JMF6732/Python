Exercise 1:
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")

ALTERNATIVE CODE:
print("""Day 1 - Python Print Function
The function is declared like this:
print('what to print')""")

OR

print("""Day 1 - Python Print Function \nThe function is declared like this: \nprint('what to print')""")

Exercise 2:

#  Fix the code - below is the correct answer 

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

Input Function:

#   The below will ask for your name, then print out Hello NAME
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")

Exercise 3:

name = input("What is your name?")
print(len(name))

OR 

print(len(input("What is your name? ")))
